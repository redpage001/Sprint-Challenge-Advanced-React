- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    You would use class components because they offer a more refined way to access the react lifecycle like with compoenentDidMount(), constructor(), and render().

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    Constructor() initializes the local state of the component and when an object is created and calls the constructor of its parent class when using super().

    Render() renders the components to the window after the Constructor is called and after changes or actions are taken in the state.

    componentDidMount() signals that components have rendered properly, is especially useful when using APIs.


- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    Custom hooks are used to create an isolated code snippet with state logic that can be reused in any other file.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    Testing our apps is important to make sure the application is working proplerly and does not break functionality when changes to the code occure.
